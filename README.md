# automata

A program in flex (using it to its fullest rather than C) that reads input files
with data for automatons (deterministic or not)  and grammers and prints the data
working in a similar fashion to a compiler,the best part is it can detect if
the automatons are deterministic or not and all 4 types of grammers in the
Chomsky scale,also handels variables global and local.
